# Portfolio

This is my portfolio for my art, design, and development work. I built this with HTML5, CSS3, and Sass using the [Bulma](http://bulma.io) framework, along with JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP.

>Currently a work in progress!

## Could I take a peek?

For now, you will need a local environment like xAMP (LAMP, MAMP, or WAMP) installed to view my portfolio. When I'm done with the final version, I will be uploading it to my domain and host, which *will* support PHP.

But for the sake of my instructors checking my work, I will have the current version in an HTML file `index.html`.
