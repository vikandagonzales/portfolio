  bio: 'I\'m a full-stack engineer, graphic and web designer, illustrator, linguist, polyglot, and gamer. I\'ve spent most of my life moving between different countries. I started making websites when I was 11 in an attempt to cope with culture shock, and it turned into one of my most long-lived passions. When I\'m not coding, I enjoy traveling, playing video and tabletop games, trying different food, playing the piano, and learning more languages.'
